# üìù Post CRUD API (Laravel + Repository Pattern)


## Description
This is a simple Laravel project that implements a RESTful API for managing blog posts using the Repository Pattern for clean and maintainable code architecture.

## üéØ Purpose of Using the Repository Pattern
## üéØ Why We Use the Repository Pattern

In this project, the Repository Pattern is used to organize the code and make it easier to maintain, test, and scale.
Instead of writing database logic directly inside controllers or services, we move it into dedicated repository classes. This helps separate concerns:

- Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Repositories handle all data access and database operations.
- Services (if used) contain the business logic.

By doing this, we get several benefits:

-  Cleaner and more readable controllers
-  Easier unit testing (thanks to dependency injection and interfaces)
-  Centralized and reusable query logic
-  Better flexibility to change the data source or logic later

This approach helps keep the application structure clean and makes it easier to grow and refactor the project in the future.
